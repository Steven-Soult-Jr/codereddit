<h1>About CodeReddit.com</h1>
Thanks for your interest in CodeReddit! We are the original site that brought you a safe way to lurk reddit while at your white collar IT job.<br />
We're back using the work of <a href="http://www.kpetrovich.com">Kyle Petrovich</a>, creator of <a href="http://www.codereddit.net">CodeReddit.net</a>, 
as a framework to rebuild ourselves.<br /><br />
Are you lost? Did you want <a href="https://github.com/reddit/">actual reddit code</a> or perhaps you're a dev looking for the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/dev/api">reddit api</a>?
<br /><br />

<p><strong>Tips for new users:</strong></p>

Clickable links will underline on hovering. These include, 
	<ul>
		<li>Function names (posts)</li>
		<li>Subreddit names in function parameter list</li>
		<li>For loop (to show comments inline)</li>
		<li>LoadComments (to view comments as a page)</li>
		<li>NextPage (to advance to the next 25 posts)</li>
	</ul>
Clicking on the "edit mode" include at the top will make the page editable, because why not. Note: you'll need to refresh to make it uneditable.
<br/ >
You can change the displayed language by clicking on the language defined in the header. It currently cycles between php, csharp, xml, python.
